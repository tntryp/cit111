/*
 This program is made by me. It is entirely free use, as per the license
shown when accessing this code.

The purpose of this program is to act as a POS tracking tool for a restaurant
specializing in sloppy joes and gyros, named aptly, Tanner's Joe/Gyro Joint.
The program uses member variables and the calling of various methods from main
to progessively calculate the amount of joes and gyros sold in a cumulative
manner.
